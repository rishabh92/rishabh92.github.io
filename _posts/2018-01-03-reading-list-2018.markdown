## Hello World!!
I started regular reading in 2017. I will continue this hobby in 2018 as well. As I am more into computer science and software engineering (geek who code :neckbeard:), I will be mostly reading technical books but I will incorporate some social books in my reading list as well. Here is my reading list:

- [The Pragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4099.The_Pragmatic_Programmer)
- [Code Complete 2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4845.Code_Complete)
- [Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring)
- [Ruby Programming: The Well-Grounded Rubyist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31297882-ruby-programming?ac=1&from_search=true)
- [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4865.How_to_Win_Friends_and_Influence_People)
- [Release It!: Design and Deploy Production-Ready Software](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1069827.Release_It_)
- [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85009.Design_Patterns)
- [The Passionate Programmer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6399113-the-passionate-programmer)
- [Building Microservices: Designing Fine-Grained Systems](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22512931-building-microservices)
- [Purely Functional Data Structures](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/594288.Purely_Functional_Data_Structures)
- [Everyone Communicates, Few Connect: What the Most Effective People Do Differently](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7715488-everyone-communicates-few-connect)


I will keep updating this blog as i gather knowledge from above list. I also plan of maintaing repositories for summaries of each book (inspired by [Hugo Matilla's The Pragmattic Programmer repository](https://github.com/HugoMatilla/The-Pragmatic-Programmer)).

Time to say Goodbye. Valar morghulis, May the Force be with you!
